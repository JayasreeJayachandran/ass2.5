 Rack:
      >rack is a group of nodes that are connected by a common network switch such that their network bandwith between different
       racks varies where it is same in the same rack.
 Rack arrangement in a hadoop cluster:
      >in order to withstand the node failure ,the replications are designed to keep in different racks .so that even a single rack
        fails therre is a copy in another rack such that it increases the fault tolerance.
      >normally the network switch connects the data nodes and name node.during the failure of network switch there is a possibility
       of losing data.so racks are introduced that there is atleast one replica in another rack such that even in the failure of one
       rack we can get it from another rack. 
      >hadoop clusters are arranged in racks such that the network traffic b/w rack is lesser.
      >In addition NameNode tries to place replicas of block on multiple racks for improved fault tolerance. 
      >the hadoop cluster decides the rack in which the datas are through configuration attributes.
      >after configuring each node gets it rack id.
      >on default all the nodes are conidered to be in a single rack.

Cluster:
     >A computer cluster is a set of interconnected computer that works parallely which is considered to be a single system.
     >It is mainly used to maintain balance load,parallel processing and fault tolerance.
     >In order to increase the power of a system ,we can add a new computer to the network.

Hadoop cluster:
   >A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of 
unstructured data in a distributed computing environment.
   >Such clusters run Hadoop's open source distributed processing software on low-cost commodity computers.
   >Typically one machine in the cluster is designated as the NameNode and another machine as JobTracker are the master machines.
   >The rest of the machines in the cluster act as both DataNode and TaskTracker are theslave machines.
   >Hadoop clusters are often referred to as "shared nothing" systems because the only thing that is shared between nodes is the 
    network that connects them. 
   >Hadoop clusters are known for boosting the speed of data analysis applications.
   >They also are highly scalable: If a cluster's processing power is overwhelmed by growing volumes of data,additional cluster nodes 
   can be added to increase throughput.
   >Hadoop clusters also are highly resistant to failure because each piece of data is copied onto other cluster nodes, 
   which ensures that the data is not lost if one node fails.
